        <h3 id="data">Data:</h3>
        <p>In computer science, data refers to a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner suitable for communication,
            interpretation, or processing by humans or automated systems. It's the fundamental raw material that computers manipulate and process to
            produce meaningful information.</p>

        <h4 id="data-types">Data Types:</h4>
        <p>The following are a few data types: <br>
            1. Numeric Data Types<br>
            2. Character and String Data Types<br>
            3. Date and Time Data Types<br>
            4. Binary Data Types<br>
            5. Boolean Data Types<br>
            6. Special Data Types<br>
        </p>

        <h3 id="database">Database:</h3>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically. It allows users and applications to easily access, update, and manipulate information.
            This data contains text, numbers, images, videos and more. Databases are managed using specialized software known as a Database Management System (DBMS),
            which facilitates the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.<br>
            Databases are fundamental to modern computing, supporting various applications from online shopping platforms to social media networks. It is widely used in
            business, government, healthcare, and many other sectors to store and manage data, enabling informed decision-making and efficient operations.
        </p>

        <h4 id="database-types">Database Types:</h4>
        <p>1. Hierarchical database model<br>
            2. Network database model<br>
            3. Relational database model<br>
            4. Centralized database model<br>
            5. Distributed database model<br>

        <h3 id="software-systems">Software Systems:</h3>
        <h4>Database Management System:</h4>
        <p>DBMS is a computerized record-keeping system. It is software that defines, manipulates, and manages the database.
            It allows access to files, updating records, and retrieving data as requested. In other words, DBMS is defined as
            the collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access that data. The collection of data is usually a
            database that contains the information about any particular organization. The primary goal of DBMS is to provide an
            effective and efficient environment for both data retrieval and storing data in the database.
            <br>Examples: MS Access, Oracle, MySQL, FoxPro, DBase, etc.
        </p>

        <h4>Accounting System:</h4>
        <p>An accounting system is software used for recording and processing accounting transactions. It helps in tracking income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
            Examples include QuickBooks, Tally, and Zoho Books.</p>

        <h4>Attendance System:</h4>
        <p>An attendance system keeps track of employee or student attendance. It helps manage and monitor punctuality, working hours, and presence.
            Examples include biometric systems, RFID-based systems, and web-based attendance software.</p>

        <h3 id="software-development">Software Development:</h3>
        <h4>Database Design:</h4>
        <p>Database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of a database. It includes defining the structure of tables, keys, relationships, and constraints
            to ensure data integrity and efficiency.</p>

        <h4>Database Administration:</h4>
        <p>Database administration involves the performance, integrity, and security of a database. DBAs are responsible for backups, tuning, user management, and ensuring
            database availability.</p>

        <h3 id="tools">Tools:</h3>
        <h4>Server:</h4>
        <p>A server in a database context is a system that provides database services to clients. It hosts the database engine, handles client queries, and manages transactions.</p>

        <h4>SQL (Structured Query Language):</h4>
        <p>SQL is used to interact with databases. It includes several sublanguages:<br>
            - DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP<br>
            - DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE<br>
            - DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT<br>
            - DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE<br>
            - SQL Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN<br>
        </p>

        <h3 id="concepts">Key Database Concepts:</h3>
        <h4>CRUD Operations:</h4>
        <p>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic functions for interacting with database records.</p>

        <h4>Keys in Database:</h4>
        <p>Keys are attributes that identify records uniquely and help establish relationships. Examples include Primary Key, Foreign Key, Candidate Key, and Composite Key.</p>

        <h4>Constraints in Database:</h4>
        <p>Constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity. Examples include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and DEFAULT.</p>

        <h4>Anomalies in Database:</h4>
        <p>Data anomalies occur due to poor database design, especially in unnormalized databases. Types include Insertion Anomaly, Deletion Anomaly, and Update Anomaly.</p>

        <h4>Normalization in Database:</h4>
        <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining
            relationships. Normal forms include 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.</p>

        <h4>Database Security:</h4>
        <p>Database security involves protecting the database from unauthorized access, threats, and breaches. It includes user authentication, encryption, access control, and regular audits.</p>
